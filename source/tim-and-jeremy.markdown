[Tim Macdonald](/) and [Jeremy Ward](http://www.jeremydavidward.com) are a
touring Scottish fiddle duo who combine traditional fiddling with historical
scholarship to create a "cutting edge" musical experience that has been
described as anything from "metal" to "baroque." Using historical instruments
and combining High Baroque compositions with high-energy dance music, their
18th-century Scottish aesthetic brings a fresh perspective to the tradition.
In 2015 they toured Scotland, performing, teaching, and jamming at concert
halls, schools, and pubs across the country.  They were a featured band at the
2015 Chicago Highland Games and regularly perform at folk dances in Chicago.

For more information about their individual accomplishments, see [Tim's bio](/bio.html)
