This is the first Scottish-style tune I ever wrote, and it happened in Colyn Fischer's living room after he firmly told me that tune-writing really wasn't
all that hard and I should just give it a try. This happened shortly before my sister Parry had a birthday, so I decided to give her the tune to honor the
occasion (well, and she's pretty cool and worthy of tune dedications in general).

There's really not much more to say. It's been collected into my [Book o' Tunes](/tunes.html), in case you're interested.
