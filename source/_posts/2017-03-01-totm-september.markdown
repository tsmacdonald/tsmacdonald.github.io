This is the first Scottish-style tune I ever wrote, and it happened in Colyn Fischer's living room after he firmly told me that tune-writing really wasn't
all that hard and I should just give it a try. This was shortly before my sister Parry had a birthday, so I decided to give her the tune to honor the
occasion (well, and she's pretty cool and generally worthy of tune dedications).

I feel obligated to mention the original source, even though it's only from 2014: my [Book o' Tunes](/tunes.html). There's really not much more to say.
