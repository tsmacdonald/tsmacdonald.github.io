Happy birthday, Abraham Mackintosh! He was born on either June 15 or June 18 in
1769, so we're splitting the difference, and was the son of the better-known
Robert Mackintosh. Baptie writes that he was a "composer of ability", which is
certainly true. He published either two (Gore) or three (Baptie) collections of
tunes (featuring both his own compositions and other popular favorites), and he
also appears fleetingly in his father's third collection under the name
"Mackintosh Junior".

His best-known tune is "Athole Brose", but we decided to highlight two lesser-known
but still excellent tunes: "Miss Hood's Strathspey" and "Miss Brandling of Gosforth's
Reel", both from his "Collection of Strathspeys, Reels, Jigs &c" of 1805.
