Happy February! Our inaugural tune of the month is the most unsatisfying tune I've ever played: the rhythm is funky, the harmony is ungrounded, and the ending is a complete surprise. But it's a braw choon anyway!

The only published copy that we know of is in [Part Fourth of Gow's Complete Repository](http://hms.scot/fiddle/source/102/). It was published around 1817—ten years after Niel's death—so presumably Nathaniel selected it.

Anyway, I hope you are thoroughly displeased by the tune! (But still enjoy it)
