I was recently asked to defend my use of syncopation while playing the reel
"The Miller", and rather than using the convenient fallbacks of, "Well, this is
the tradition, and my teacher's teacher's teacher's…teachers include Niel Gow and
Corelli" (a horrible argument for anyone who claims to practice
historically-informed performance, as can be verified by spending ten seconds
listening to my more immediate musical ancestors, Hector MacAndrew and Eugène
Ysaÿe) or "I have a paid research fellowship at a prestigious institution to
study this nonsense, so bugger off" I figured I should actually, you know,
respond appropriately.

This is a specific topic that I plan to discuss in the paper I'm writing for my
work at the Newberry Library; unfortunately I haven't gotten there yet. So
please consider this post to be a loose collection of thoughts pending further
exploration to take place by the end of June.

Any discussion of Scottish rhythm should start with Philip Tagg's wonderful
documentary on Scotch snaps. Unfortunately, though [he has a very nice
discussion of
polyrhythm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHB3pA7iCSg&feature=youtu.be&t=880),
he doesn't address syncopation per se. We must turn to primary sources.

My Newberry research is focused on Robert Mackintosh's second collection
("Sixty eight new Reels Strathspeys Quicksteps…"), and it's loaded with nice
examples. His reels, for example, universally tie together consecutive eighth
notes of the same value.  The first page demonstrates this nicely with "The
Jockey Club":

The effect is intensified in the last reel of the collection, "Miss Betty
Robertson's Reel", by adding in dotted quarter notes and eighth note groups
slurred in threes. The first half of bar four is also worth highlighting—while
it looks like four straight eighth notes, the descending figure ending with the
open D string gives it a nice off-beat flavor.

Moving on from reels, we see that the same "tie the same note across the beat" rule
holds for jigs. No further comment necessary:

There's not too much chamber music in the collection, but "The Duchess of Gordon's Delight"
does have a nice syncopated section as part of a variation:

</figure>

And finally, the one 4/4 hornpipe has a less-obvious form of syncopation. Rather than the traditional
"pom-pom-pom" figure of three quarter notes every few bars, Mackintosh opts for the "pom-paaaaah" of
a quarter note followed by a half note:

Regarding strathspeys, arguments could be made that the arrow stroke (which
Mackintosh provides ample opportunity for) is a form of syncopation, but I
don't want to go there. The other tune forms prove my point well enough.

I have Mackintosh on the brain since my fellowship's about him, but I don't
want to give the impression that he's the sole torchbearer of Scottish
syncopation. [February's Tune of the Month](/blog/2016/02/18/febtotm/) has
wild syncopation courtesy of the Gows, and you can also see it in such
diverse places as Bremner's wonderfully-Scottish variations on "The East Neuk
of Fife" (unfortunately I no longer have a copy handy) and Alexander Munro's
Italianate variations on "Bonny Jean of Aberdeen":

Future work involves finding examples of instances that *could* have been
syncopated but weren't (e.g., a composer who sometimes-but-not-always ties
eighth notes together the way Mackintosh does), but for now it looks like
syncopation in various forms was a mainstay of 18th century Scottish violin
music.
