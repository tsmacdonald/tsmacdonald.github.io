Praised for his "impressive and stylistically Scottish playing" ([Melinda
Crawford](http://www.melindacrawford.com/)) and heralded as "a *real* fiddler"
([Bonnie Rideout](http://www.bonnierideout.com/)), Tim Macdonald is a regular
performer, scholar, composer, and teacher of Scottish-Baroque music.

Tim was the first US National Scottish Fiddling Champion to win on a Baroque violin, and his performances with [Trio
Settecento](http://www.triosettecento.com/), [Susie Petrov](http://susiepetrov.com/), [Colyn
Fischer](http://www.scotsduo.com/), the [Bach and Beethoven Ensemble](http://www.bbensemble.org/), and many others have
taken him from New York City's Frick Collection to the villages of Indonesia, countless country and contra dances,
Scotland's Blair Castle, and beyond. Recent projects include helping to perform Scotland's first opera, <i>The Gentle
Shepherd</i>, in full for the first time in over two centuries, lecturing on applying the rhetorical ideas of the
Scottish Enlightenment to modern fiddling, playing fully-staged Elizabethan jigs with [Steve
Player](http://www.strangeandancientinstruments.com/page3/styled-4/index.html), joining classical superstar <a
href="http://rachelbartonpine.com/">Rachel Barton Pine</a> for an encore of traditional tunes following her performance
of Bruch's *Scottish Fantasy*, and serving as music and dancing master at a thoroughly-researched recreation of a
1770s American tavern.  His radio appearances include WQXR classical radio (New York City), BBC Scotland's <i>Take the
Floor</i>, and WBOM radio (Rockford, IL).


In addition to performing, Tim runs a private teaching studio and is on faculty at [The Jink and Diddle School of
Scottish Fiddling](http://www.jinkdiddle.com). His compositions have won first place at the first two Scottish FIRE
Composition Competitions and are now available [in print](/tunes.html). A "remarkably capable" scholar as well as a
player ([Johann Buis](http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/B/Johann-Buis)), Tim was an Arthur and Lila Weinberg Fellow
at the [Newberry Library](http://newberry.org/) for the 2015-16 academic year, where he researched the period-correct
performance of Scottish-Baroque music, focusing on the work of Robert Mackintosh. He has guest lectured at Wheaton
College (IL), the National Centre for Excellence in Traditional Music (Plockton, Scotland), and elsewhere, and his paper
on Mackintosh was accepted at the 2017 Musica Scotica conference in Stirling. He also plays the viola d'amore,
harpsichord, and concertina, serves on the board of the [Great Lakes Baroque](http://www.greatlakesbaroque.org/) (with
artistic director [Jory Vinikour](http://www.joryvinikour.com) and on the leadership team of his local church, is an
