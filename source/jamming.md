In collaboration with the [Illinois St. Andrew
Society](http://www.chicagoscots.org/), Tim is leading a Scottish jam session
on certain Tuesdays.

All sessions will take place at the [Duke of Perth](http://dukeofperth.com/) in
Lincoln Park (2913 N Clark St), begin at 7PM, and run until 9 or so.  Everyone
is encouraged to play their favorite Scottish tunes, but newcomers to the
Scottish style might find it useful to look over the collection of [tunes we'll
probably play](assets/jam-tunes.pdf).

## Upcoming Dates

* They're being scheduled for the fall, stay tuned!
