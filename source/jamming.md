In collaboration with the [Illinois St. Andrew
Society](http://www.chicagoscots.org/), Tim is leading a Scottish jam session
every Tuesday evening.

All sessions will take place at the [Duke of Perth](http://dukeofperth.com/) in
Lincoln Park (2913 N Clark St), begin at 7PM, and run until 9 or so.  Everyone
is encouraged to play their favorite Scottish tunes, but newcomers to the
Scottish style might find it useful to look over the collection of [tunes we'll
probably play](assets/jam-tunes.pdf).

**Please Note:** The jam will go on hiatus for Christmas, and we will not meet
on December 22 or December 29. We hope to see you on December 15 and in the new
year on January 5!
